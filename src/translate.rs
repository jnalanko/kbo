//! Translating deterministic _k_-bounded matching statistics into alignments.
//!
//! The translated alignment is encoded using the following characters:
//! - **M** : Match between query and reference.
//! - **-** : Characters in the query that are not found in the reference.
//! - **X** : Single character mismatch or insertion into the query.
//! - **R** : Two consecutive 'R's signify a discontinuity in the alignment.
//!           The right 'R' is at the start of a _k_-mer that is not adjacent
//!           to the last character in the _k_-mer corresponding to the left
//!           'R'. This implies either a deletion of unknown length in the query,
//!           or insertion of _k_-mers from elsewhere in the reference into the query.
//!
//! ## Translation algorithm for _k_-bounded matching statistics
//! TODO Describe how the different MS vectors translate into alignments.

/// Returns a tuple containing the translation of the current MS and
/// translation of the right neighbor match. The right neighbor is an
/// empty string literal ' ' if translation of the current MS does not
/// affect its value.
