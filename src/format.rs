//! Converting alignment representations into various output formats.

/// Extracts run length encodings from a translated alignment.
///
/// Traverses the character representation of the alignment stored in `aln` and
/// counts the consecutive run lengths of sections that align to the reference.
/// A base is counted as aligned if its character representation is not '-' or ' '.
///
/// This function can be used for both plain and refined translations.
///
/// Returns a vector where each element contains 4 elements with the contents:
/// - Start position of a run of consecutive characters (indexing starts from 1).
/// - End position of a run of consecutive characters (indexing starts from 1).
/// - Number matching bases in the run (character representation is 'M' or 'R').
/// - Number mismatching bases in the run (character representation is not 'M', '-', or ' ').
///
/// The run length is the sum of the matching and mismatching bases.
///
/// # Examples
/// ## Extract run lengths from a character representation

/// Format a refined translation relative to the reference sequence.

/// Jointly reads nucleotides from the reference sequence `ref_seq` and the
/// character representation of an alignment `alignment` to determine the
/// nucleotide sequence of the alignment relative to the reference.
///
/// Only works with refined translations as the input (TODO verify).
///
/// Returns a vector containing alignment of the query against `ref_seq` in a
/// gapped alignment format.
///
/// Valid characters in the return format are:
/// - 'A', 'C', 'G', 'T': the nucleotide in the query sequence.
/// - '-': gap in the query.
///
/// If `alignment` is a refined translation, the nucleotides ACGT in the return
/// value may differ from the reference sequence and the gaps '-' represent
/// sections absent from the query.
///
/// If `alignment` is an unrefined translation, the nucleotides ACGT are always
/// the same as in the reference sequence. Gaps '-' may represent either
/// unresolved SNPs, insertions, or absent sections.

/// ## Format a refined translation

/// TODO Add test to relative_to_ref documentation.
